                In order to accelerate his students study of impulse and momentum, Lord H devised a plan
                unlike any other. Most physics professors would stop at throwing a student off of a tall building.
                Not Lord H. He decided to throw himself out of a helicoptor instead. This jump also furthered the 
                effort to replace god with Lord H. Defying all known laws of aviation, physics teachers can fly.
