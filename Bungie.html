                Apparantly jumping out of planes wasn't enough. To mess with the directors of goldeneye, Lord
                H decided to systamatically prove that they are wrong. He jumped off of a dam
                to show that once you reached the bottom, the stretched elastic fights back. James bond was
                strong enough to resist this force, but Lord H wasn't impressed. H decided to prove that you can't just
                defy the laws of physics when ever you want. Lord H attempted to stop the bungie cord from bouncing up and down
                after the fall but he failed. IF LORD H CAN'T DO IT THAN JAMES BOND CAN'T EVEN COME CLOSE. The directors were liars
                and they will be punished.
