                To honor our great physics deity, all physicist are now REQUIRED to measure momentum in Haslings.
                The shorthand notation for this will simply be "h". Any other units that use "h" as a variable are 
                deemed unimportant and therefore require a name change. Any physicist who does not adhere to these
                new regulations will have their doctorate removed as punishment.
